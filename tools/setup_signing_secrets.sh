# Needs: gh, signed in as an admin of midst-press (brew install gh; gh auth login). It asks
# nothing. It checks each certificate matches its key and comes from Apple's G2 authority, builds
# a .p12 for each with a random password that only ever exists in GitHub, and sets seven secrets:
#   CSC_LINK, CSC_KEY_PASSWORD, CSC_INSTALLER_LINK, CSC_INSTALLER_KEY_PASSWORD,
#   APPLE_API_KEY, APPLE_API_KEY_ID, APPLE_API_ISSUER
# Running it again replaces them, which is how credentials are rotated. The step-by-step process,
# including making the keys and certificates, is in docs/macos-signing.md.
